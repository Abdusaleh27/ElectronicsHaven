### Project Features

1. Built an e-commerce platform that utilizes Best Buy's API to provide real-time product listings according
   to user searches.

2. Created dynamic customer experiences by showcasing the most viewed and trending products on the landing page.
   Implemented many features such adding and removing products from shopping cart and wish list, displaying product details,
   search filters, and sorting search results by price or customer rating.

3. Used React for building the front end along with Material UI for a responsive, dynamic, and visually appealing website.

4. Used AWS Amplify functionalities such as Cognito for creating and authenticating users, Graphql and DynamoDB for storing
   customer’s data, and implemented Express RESTful APIs secured by AWS IAM roles for interacting with Best Buy and Stripe
   APIs in the back end eliminating the exposure of secret API keys.

5. Integrated a secure payment gateway using Stripe for a seamless checkout.

6. Addressed Best Buy API’s product search limitations by enhancing search functionality using search filters and sorting options,
   significantly improving the accuracy of search results, and enhancing the overall user’s experience.
